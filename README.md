# DevOps Portfolio Website

A clean, fast, and fully extensible DevOps portfolio site built to showcase my experience in Cloud, CI/CD, Automation, and Infrastructure Engineering.  
This is the first minimal version, designed with scalability in mind and ready to integrate into a complete AWS-powered deployment pipeline.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This site introduces who I am as a DevOps Engineer and provides a foundation for future enhancements such as automated deployments, dynamic content, and project showcases.  
It is intentionally lightweight (HTML, CSS, JS) to keep performance high while being simple to iterate on.

Future versions will integrate a modern CI/CD pipeline using AWS services and demonstrate real-world automation practices.

## 🔧 Tech Snapshot

- **HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JS**  
- **Bilingual content (EN/ES)**  
- **Emoji-based language switcher**  
- **Modular translation system (JSON)**  
- **GitHub repository for version control**  
- **Ready for AWS S3, CloudFront, Lambda, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline**

## 🧩 Why This Repo Exists

Recruiters and companies often want:
- A **quick, clear view** of your skills  
- A **demonstration of how you build and automate**  
- A **tangible artifact** of your DevOps mindset  

This repo is that starting point.  
The upcoming CI/CD pipeline and automation around this site will act as a practical example of how I work.
