  "about": {
    "body": "<p>By day, I keep pipelines running and infrastructure stable for a U.S. banking client — the kind of environment where deploys need to be boring and failures are expensive.</p><p>Nights and weekends, I co-build side projects at <a href=\"https://delete-from.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">delete-from.com</a> with a partner. The idea: ship fast MVPs, see what solves real problems, iterate or cut.</p><p>I'm also a dad — which means I've gotten good at ruthless prioritization. No ceremony, no complexity that doesn't earn its place. It makes me a better engineer.</p><p>I got into DevOps because I hate doing the same thing twice. If a process is tedious and repetitive, it should be automated. Based in Santiago, Chile 🇨🇱 — open to remote work with teams in LATAM or the USA.</p>"
